It published a report, suggesting ways and means to keep the rise in temperatures down to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In this context, it will be interesting to read Vandana Shiva&rsquo;s memoir, <em>Terra Viva</em> (Women Unlimited), in which she talks about her life working with farmers&rsquo; and people&rsquo;s movements across the world against &ldquo;seed imperialism&rdquo;, economic polarisation and the &ldquo;digital colonisation of our ecological and social diversity.&rdquo; She looks ahead to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis, the privatisation of biotechnology, and the &ldquo;commodification of our biological and natural resources.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reviews, we read G.N.

It shines bright despite the historical precedence of the <em>Ramayana </em>and its obvious lineages in the obscurity of the Vedas <em>. </em>Philosophically, there are other scriptures dense with meaning that have engaged scholarly attention far longer. What then accounts for India&rsquo;s enduring fascination with the <em>Mahabharata</em>? Literary critic and archaeologist of language Ganesh N. Devy attempts to answer this in his book, <em>Mahabharata, The Epic and the Nation</em> (Aleph). In his review, Sukumar Muralidharan writes that the essence of the <em>Mahabharata </em>is perhaps its recounting of a story where the origins are &ldquo;perennially open&rdquo;, affording a unique civilisational foundation for India. Unlike other epics, it has no single protagonist who provides narrative continuity from beginning to end, aside from Ved Vyasa himself. &ldquo;The <em>Mahabharata </em>is a way of perceiving a past of many beginnings, where time in all its dimensions &ndash;cosmic, mythical, historical and psychological -- fuse together. There are aspects of the <em>Mahabharata </em>that legitimise the worst of an ascriptive, hierarchical social order. But in the vastness of its sprawl, it provides a richness of narrative detail and moral ambiguities, to be a relatable tale for all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><em><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/mahabharata-the-epic-and-the-nation-review-mahabharatas-enduring-appeal/article65289578.ece\" target=\"_self\">Mahabharata, The Epic and the Nation</a></em><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/mahabharata-the-epic-and-the-nation-review-mahabharatas-enduring-appeal/article65289578.ece\" target=\"_self\"> review: <em>Mahabharata</em>&rsquo;s enduring appeal</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Captain Krishnan Nair was a bit of a &ldquo;rolling stone&rdquo; in his early days ( <em>Capture the Dream</em>/Bachi Karkaria &ndash; Juggernaut). He joined the army, resigned, ventured into supervising ration distribution in Kerala, joined politics for a while and then went back to the army. The smart armyman impressed a local industrialist in Kannur who got his daughter Leela married to him. Every project of the captain was named after Leela, his &ldquo;guiding force&rdquo;. It was Leela who wanted captain to build a hotel. But first, says the reviewer Sushila Ravindranath, Captain Nair joined his father-in-law&rsquo;s handloom business as a sales agent. Thus began his foray into handlooms and exports. Success came when he introduced the &lsquo;Bleeding Madras&rsquo;, a humble homespun fabric, to the U.S. His entrepreneurial brain was always ticking. When he was 65 years old, Captain Nair entered the competitive hotel industry. He wanted to prove to international visitors that India can build world class hotels and even outdo them. He was not fazed by the existing top class competition, Taj, Oberoi and the ITC groups. &ldquo;At every stage of his life, he managed to achieve what he wanted to, turning disadvantages into advantages.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><em><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/capture-the-dream-the-many-lives-of-captain-cp-krishnan-nair-review-in-his-time-captain-krishnan-nair-played-many-parts/article65289492.ece\" target=\"_self\">Capture the Dream: The Many Lives of Captain C.P.

Vijaya Kumar. &ldquo;He is also constantly placing them within the boundaries imposed by a nation in a state of flux.

The man is white and he&rsquo;s clearly been shot &ndash; this discovery triggers far-reaching reactions. With Indian and U.S. intelligence agencies involved in the cover-up, Fletcher is soon bundled off to the U.S. But once in the U.S., the CIA approaches him, telling him his fluent Hindi and his cover as an ornithologist are very useful assets. Fletcher accepts their offer to join the agency, not least because he can live in India, and thereby hangs a thrilling tale. In her review, Ranjana Sengupta writes that the novel has a certain deliberate, unhurried pace rather like, one imagines, the art of watching birds. Each chapter too begins with a bird description and the bird finds its way into the chapter, often just a flutter of wings, but a happy distraction from the combustible geopolitics of the moment, a sign that the natural world goes on even as men get ready to kill each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/society/ranjana-sengupta-reviews-stephen-alters-birdwatching/article65273302.ece\" target=\"_self\">They come home to roost: Ranjana Sengupta reviews Stephen Alter&rsquo;s &lsquo;Birdwatching&rsquo;</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Spotlight</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"A portrait of sad poor mature mother talking to small daughter indoors at home, poverty concept.\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/90zrfb/article65314345.ece/alternates/FREE_660/IMG_10LR_Srilata1_2_1_189LJ0CL.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her column Women of Letters, K.

They were forced to move westward till they reached the banks of another river, the Ganga, which too has a mind of its own, often flowing off in a different direction, or causing floods and leaving mudflats (or chars) behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researching for his book in the Sunderbans, Ghosh wrote in his notes: &ldquo;I do believe it to be true that the land here is demonstrably alive &mdash; overnight a stretch of riverbank will disappear, sometimes taking houses and people with it, but elsewhere a shallow mudbank will arise and within weeks the shore will have broadened by several feet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parimal Bhattacharya shines a light on people who live on such mudflats, or others on the edge of cities, in <em>Field Notes from a Waterborne Land</em>. If his memoir, <em>No Path in Darjeeling is Straight</em> (2017), gave readers a sense of the place and its people, in <em>Field Notes</em>, he shares insights from places he travelled to in the late 2000s, meeting those living in the shadows, in the Sundarbans, villages on the Bangladesh border or around Santiniketan, and the tribals in the Simlipal forests of Odisha. Through the book, he uses the thread of Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay&rsquo;s famous debut novel, <em>Pather Panchali</em>, the story of two children, Durga and Apu, growing up poor in a village otherwise filled with rich forests, a river and many ponds, and a rail track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In Apu&rsquo;s world </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bhattacharya compares notes with the book and Satyajit Ray&rsquo;s trilogy based on it. Ray had been taken in by Bibhutibhushan&rsquo;s encyclopaedic map of rural Bengal, which is mostly gone, and its people, and the contrasts between &ldquo;the rich and the poor, the laughter and the tears, the beauty of the countryside and the grimness of poverty existing in it.&rdquo; Bhattacharya remembers Apu&rsquo;s world as he visits several places associated with Bibhutibhushan. The bokul tree at the writer&rsquo;s home at Chalki-Barrackpur by the river Ichamati is still standing, but little else remains from that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a waterborne land, the story of loss begins with the drying up of swamps and tributaries, and frequent floods. With these occurrences, &ldquo;a whole way of life&rdquo; disappears. Flood refugees of Nabadwip are constantly thinking of ways to survive the next wave of water. &ldquo;Our foremost priority is human lives. Then we&rsquo;ll think of livestock, then the lands, and then comes lyakapora (reading and writing or education),&rdquo; a panchayat leader tells Bhattacharya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fisherman uprooted by the river a dozen times says settlers on the char cannot afford to be scared of floods, but as sand mining proliferates, erosion too has increased and chunks of land vanish into the river in the blink of an eye.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rafi&rsquo;s tragedy </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In seven chapters, Bhattacharya introduces readers to many unforgettable characters, but perhaps the most poignant story is of Rafiqul Islam, the only boy from Sheikhpara who is in Class 10 but had not been coming to school for a month. His teacher Ananda Roy decided to find out why.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the village, Roy and the writer found Rafiqul&rsquo;s father Uchiar Ali stirring a pot of amber liquid (date palm syrup). His father explained the absence &mdash; Rafiqul has to help with the gur (jaggery)-making. Questions about syllabus and exams hang in the air. Rafi will never finish school but his mother thanks the teacher for always understanding whether her son had eaten or not. You cannot ask, explains Roy, you need to study their faces to know the truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <em>Field Notes</em>, Bhattacharya has studied faces of people who live on the margins to narrate a story of deep loss and remarkable survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Field Notes from a Waterborne Land: Bengal Beyond the Bhadralok</strong></em> <strong>; Parimal Bhattacharya, HarperCollins, ₹499. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>sudipta.datta@thehindu.co.in</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n","section_id":"8"},{"article_id":"44","company":"The Hindu","img_url":"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/pe7qgu/article65326169.ece/alternates/FREE_660/17SM%20Manu.jpg","location":"","title":"magazine","section":"Books","created_at":"2022-04-18 12:30:10","description":"<div class=\"articleLead\"> Through Ravi Varma’s paintings, a historian explores how princes, their queens and ministers deftly played the chess game set by the British Raj in pre-Independent India </div><p>A dot here, a daub there and a brush stroke later, Manu S. Pillai brings to life the world of princely India between the Great War of Indian Independence and India’s Independence in his latest book <i >False Allies</i>. </p><p>The book is a revelation about an India caught between the mandarins of the Raj, the rising scribal class of Indians and five princes as it follows the footsteps of Raja Ravi Varma. While Ravi Varma may be credited with creating the images of Hindu mythology, it is his commissioned work in royal households that Pillai uses to tell a tale that’s different from the one we are used to hearing and reading. </p><p>Pillai, who also happens to be a Malayali, uses the artist’s life and work as a sutradhar (a connecting thread) between the kingdoms of the five princes. He smashes the notion that the royalty of pre-independent India was only about exotic lifestyles, indulging in baubles of extravagance or wasting away in a haze of opioids. Instead, a complex nuanced world is revealed using the royal goings on in Travancore, Padukkottai, Baroda, Mysore, and Mewar. Pillai shows the readers how the princes, their queens and ministers deftly played the chess game set by the British Raj. </p><p> <b >Art as backdrop </b></p><p>A gorgeous collection of Raja Ravi Varma’s paintings is used to show the courtly drama with the frame becoming the backstory of how a painting came to be. Indeed, one of the revelations in the book is how close the princely states were working towards a constitutional mode of governance based on laws, and not just royal whimsy as we have been previously led to believe. </p><p>Pillai shows the political savvy of Maharaja Sayaji Rao whose story is the stuff of dreams beginning as an illiterate farmhand to guiding the destiny of Baroda. “The system that divides us into innumerable castes... is a whole tissue of injustice, splitting men equal by nature into divisions high and low, based... on the accident of birth,” writes Pillai, quoting the Maharajah who supported the education of B.R. Ambedkar at one point of time. This description is a far cry from exotic images created by earlier historians. Describing the same prince, Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre wrote in <i >Freedom at Midnight</i>: “The Maharaja of Baroda practically worshipped gold and precious stones. His court tunic was of spun gold and only one family in his state was allowed to weave its threads. The fingernails of each member of the family were grown to extraordinary length, then cut and notched like the teeth of a comb so they could caress the gold threads into perpendicular perfection.” It is this contrast that Pillai shatters with ease. </p><p>Pillai is in his element when he narrates the dealings between officials of the Raj and princes of Travancore. The jackfruit murder of Mavelikara brings alive his story-telling skill as he marshals his reference material to tell the tale which was sought to be wiped away by the royal house considering the tawdry nature of the crime. The 1862 crime where a man is beaten with a jackfruit on his abdomen and private parts provides the link between the House of Travancore and artist Raja Ravi Varma. </p><p> <b >Sham fairplay </b></p><p>Then there is the restored maharajah of Mysore who loses his kingdom due to machinations of wily Raj officials. Then he regains it after a lengthy diplomatic battle over treaties and pledges. But not before there is a change of government in the British isles in 1866. By unravelling the inner working of the British Raj’s chicanery, Pillai shows that the notion of British fairplay was just a sham. </p><p>The author has unearthed a trove of interactions (the book has 128 pages of notes) between scribes, Dewans and Raj officials, to show how well the Indian royalty had not only mastered the language of their ‘masters’ but were also willing to challenge them. </p><p>The book is also a tale about the early adopters of English language in India: Brahmins. Pillai chronicles in some detail about the rise of two men, one of whom begins his career in the Accountant General’s office while his friend begins his as a clerk in the Madras Board of Revenue. These gentlemen end up becoming Dewans who help frame the policies of the kings. It is in their work that Pillai dwells on the minutiae of the bureaucracy and political diplomacy to flesh out the difference between the perception of royalty as cut off from reality to one of individuals aware of the nitty-gritty of realpolitik.</p><p>If one has to have a grouse about the book, it is the over-reliance of the author on sources in English, considering how much more loaded the courtly intrigue would be in the native tongue. Although a little late in the day, Pillai’s <i >False Allies</i> is a must read in these days where dozens of historians are being freshly minted every day. </p><p> <i > <b >False Allies: India’s Maharajahs in the Age of Ravi Varma</b></i> <b >; Manu S.

The name of the song is usually used in a phrase that refers to someone being defeated or encountering something they cannot overcome. It refers to a particular field in Belgium where Napoleon Bonaparte was finally defeated by the British. What is the name of the song that finishes the phrase, &ldquo;To meet your _____&rdquo;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Show Answer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A: </strong> Waterloo</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: </strong>This is a common phrase that is used to explain that something is just a small part of a much larger problem. The saying comes from the fact that only a very small part of a large body, mentioned in it, is visible. This gives a misleading impression about its size. What is this saying, which you might use in conversation or if you were sailing out at sea?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Show Answer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A: </strong> It&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: </strong>This phrase, which refers to an event that happens rarely, is based on a particular 29-day cycle. Naturally, this event should happen once every two and a half years. When this does happen though, there is no change in the colour of the object mentioned in the phrase. One theory is that the only time the colour changed was in 1883 when the Indonesian volcano Krakatoa exploded and spewed ash, which caused this colour change for more than a year. What phrase is this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Show Answer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A: </strong> Once in a blue moon</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: </strong>This phrase is used to refer to someone who is very practical or matter-of-fact. It could be in contrast to someone who has &lsquo;their head in a cloud&rsquo; or is not very realistic. One theory for its origin is that it may allude to angels or other celestial creatures being &lsquo;cast down&rsquo; to join mortal humans. What is this phrase that means that someone is realistic and &lsquo;grounded&rsquo;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Show Answer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A: </strong> Down to earth</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: </strong>This description of an intense weather phenomenon involves two animals. The phrase may come from the fact that in early times these animals used to sleep on rafters of the roof. Under certain conditions it could become slippery and they might fall down. Another explanation is that the Norse god of thunder, Odin, is often pictured with one type of animal, whereas the other animal is associated with witches who are said to cause this phenomenon. What is this phrase?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Show Answer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A: </strong> Raining cats and dogs</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: </strong>This popular children&rsquo;s game was earlier known as &lsquo;Russian Scandals&rsquo; and acquired its present name much later. The name stems from a racist idea that a particular country&rsquo;s people spoke in a way that was deliberately unintelligible. The game involves listening to someone, trying to understand what you heard, and then passing that on to the next person as accurately as you can. Known as &lsquo;telephone game&rsquo; in the U.S., what is it known as in India and the U.K.?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Show Answer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A: </strong> Chinese Whispers</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: </strong>This phrase may refer to the fact that in some cases moist air is sucked up by the clouds and dry and warm air descends, which is more stable, and thus more still, leading to a feeling of quiet. However, the clouds that drew away the moist air then get into action. What is the associated phrase that refers to a peaceful or untroubled period that exists just before things get chaotic?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Show Answer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A: </strong> The calm before the storm</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: </strong>This idiom is used to express the idea that something went wrong and then continued to get worse or escalate. It is based on the fact that if you set something off on a slope, thanks to the effect of gravity, it is likely to keep following the same trajectory. What is this phrase you can use to talk about things going wrong?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Show Answer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A: </strong> Thing going downhill</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: </strong>This phrase, about a natural phenomenon, is often used when something good happens and suggests that it may not happen again. This is not scientifically true: in reality, this event can happen multiple times in the same place. In fact, Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela is on record for having the most number of these events happening in a year. What is this phrase that is completely untrue (and hence dangerous advice to someone caught in a storm)?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Show Answer</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A: </strong> Lightning never strikes the same place twice</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Q: </strong>A common explanation for this expression is that it refers to a certain classification system that was introduced in the 1800s. As amateur meteorologists all followed their own system of classification, the &lsquo;International _____ Atlas&rsquo; came into being as a standard. The early versions of the Atlas placed the &lsquo;cumulonimbus&rsquo; at a certain position on the list. The cumulonimbus is fluffy in nature, and found at the highest altitude, features that put it in that position on the list, which may have given rise to this phrase.

Now, Vijay, considered one of the best dancers in the industry, is doing just that — dance steps that are literally child’s play.</p><p>In the recent Tamil track &#039;Jolly O Gymkhana&#039; from <i >Beast</i>, composed by Anirudh, the actor hops and jumps, keeping steps simple and easy to imitate. The result? 40 million-plus views on YouTube, partly powered by hundreds of Instagram Reels&#039; users trying out the steps. </p><p>A few months ago, everyone was imitating the actors of &#039;Naatu Naatu&#039; ( <i >RRR</i>). And before that, it was &#039;Vaathi Coming&#039;, &#039;Butta Bomma&#039;, &#039;Tum Tum&#039; and &#039;Rowdy Baby&#039;. All these superhit songs have one thing in common: the hook step. </p><p>Choreographers and directors are increasingly looking out for simple, easy-to-do dance moves, like tapping your thigh or rotating your shoulder, which audiences can recreate in the comfort of their homes. Audiences no longer want to just watch in awe as a star dances, now they want to do it too. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/3t3m2e/article65317555.ece/alternates/FREE_660/beast61.jpg\" alt=\"A still from Beast\" title=\"A still from Beast\" source=\"SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT\" width=\"100%\"/> <p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nelson-dilipkumar-on-beast/article65313646.ece\" target=\"_self\" >Nelson</a>, the director of <i >Beast</i>, says that a hook step has become an integral part of today’s cinema. For instance, in ‘Arabic Kuthu’, which has Vijay and Pooja Hegde grooving to catchy music, the moves were meticulously planned. “The reason we wanted a song like that in the first place was to ensure that everybody dances to it,” says Nelson. These steps, choreographed by Jani Master, have inspired audiences, from film stars like Varun Dhawan and Rashmika Mandanna, to cricketer Venkatesh Iyer. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/lingusamy-on-staying-relevant-in-the-film-industry/article37538274.ece\" target=\"_self\" >Director Lingusamy</a> is currently trying to crack that formula for his upcoming Tamil-Telugu bilingual <i >The Warriorr</i>, with the help of dance choreographers Sekar Master and Jani Master. &quot;Kamal Haasan once told me about how popular producer Thevar (of Thevar films) selected his songs: he would listen to a track, and gauge whether his body moved to it. He used to give a go ahead only to songs that he himself moved to,&quot; says Lingusamy, &quot;Similarly, today, the fate of a song depends on its popularity on social media; so, we work on steps that are easy and simple.&quot;</p><p> <b >In sync with each other</b></p><p>Though Australian cricketer David Warner, well known for his fun spins on popular film songs on social media, has still not done a ‘Naatu Naatu’ Instagram reel yet, it is probably just a matter of time. After all, the hook step of director Rajamouli’s <i >RRR</i> track, revealed in November 2021, helped generate enough anticipation for the film to offset some of the challenges posed by multiple pandemic delays. The promo video showing actors NTR and Ram Charan matching steps in electrifying speed spawned several dance cover videos and Instagram reels. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/l1viu5/article65317557.ece/alternates/FREE_660/RRR-RRR.jpg\" alt=\"A still from ‘RRR’\" title=\"A still from ‘RRR’\" source=\"SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>Choreographer Prem Rakshith, who had worked with NTR and Rajamouli for some of their earlier films, also put out a tutorial for the hook step on YouTube. The team filmed in Kyiv, Ukraine, for two weeks and had the local dancers grooving alongside the lead actors. </p><p>“Rajamouli wanted us to be in perfect sync so that even if a viewer plays the video slowly and observes carefully, our moves should match,” NTR stated during the pre-release media interaction. It took Ram Charan and NTR nearly 17 takes before the director approved of their synchronisation of the hook step. “It felt torturous at that time to do it repeatedly. Once the dance became a rage, I could appreciate Rajamouli’s vision,” the actor added. </p><p>Till date, newer dance cover versions of ‘Naatu Naatu’ keep popping up online. There is even a Laurel and Hardy mash-up. </p><p>Early in 2020, the ‘Butta Bomma’ song from <i >Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo</i> created a frenzy, with several TikTok videos imitating Allu Arjun and Pooja Hegde’s moves. Allu Arjun then followed it up with the hit song ‘Srivalli’ from <i >Pushpa — the Rise</i>. Its director Sukumar says, “We think of Reels or YouTube Shorts all the time, especially while writing dialogues or lyrics. That way, a buzz is generated among audiences, thus helping the film reach more people.”</p><p>Shanthnu Bhagyaraj, well known for his dancing skills, has just put out his cover of ‘Arabic Kuthu’. Along with his wife, Kiki Vijay, and her dance studio students, all from different walks of life, the actor has created an engaging choreography that is easy to replicate. “We wanted to do a blend of the hook steps that audiences are familiar with along with something of our own,” says Shanthnu, who routinely posts dance videos on his social media. The couple’s earlier cover of &#039;Vaathi Coming&#039; fetched more than 17 million views and drew the attention of Vijay himself — who borrowed a step from it and danced during a stage show. “Doing such covers and getting all the hook steps right gives us a lot of joy.” </p><p> <b >Cause for celebration</b></p><p>If Tamil and Telugu film industries are rocking the dance moves, Malayalam cinema isn&#039;t too far behind. ‘Parudeesa’ and ‘Rathipushpam’, from the Mammootty-starrer <i >Bheeshma Parvam</i>, directed by Amal Neerad, have gone viral for their fluid synchronised dance moves. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/87w9r0/article65317564.ece/alternates/FREE_660/rathipurusan1.JPG\" alt=\"A still from ‘Bheeshma Parvam’\" title=\"A still from ‘Bheeshma Parvam’\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/choreographer-sumesh-sundar-jishnudas/article65086617.ece\" target=\"_self\" >Choreographer Sumesh Sundar </a>says some of the initial steps in ‘Parudeesa...’ were planned to enthuse youngsters to try it out too. “The hook step of ‘Rathipushpam’ is based on the movement of your hips,&quot; explains Sumesh, “To get it right, one has to bend the body from the waist and then swing back. The dance is based on the dance concept of ‘lock’, where fast steps are paused for a bit before moving on to the next.&quot;</p><p>Malayalam cinema also seems to have cracked the ‘wedding song’ formula; of an entire group celebrating a special occasion. If back in 2014, ‘Thodakkam Mangalyam’ ( <i >Bangalore Days</i>) was the rage during marriage celebrations, today, <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/divya-vineeth-on-how-she-ended-up-singing-for-films-especially-hridayam/article38297515.ece\" target=\"_self\" >‘Onakka Mundhiri’</a> from <i >Hridayam </i>is among the latest hits among social media users for covers and Reels. “In Malabar, on the eve of a wedding, relatives pitch in to help and grandmas sing, while they go about their work. Once that visual came to my mind, the rest of the song fell in place,” says director Vineeth Srinivasan. </p><p>The simpler, the better, seems to be the magic formula now. This has changed the way directors, composers and choreographers think... thus including song promos even for films that do not feature songs, making it a marketing tool. Adds Lingusamy, “A few decades ago, composers would specifically ask directors about which &#039;reel&#039; in the film the song would be placed, and tune it accordingly. Today too, it&#039;s the Reel that decides its popularity.” </p><p> <i >(With inputs from Srivatsan S, Sangeetha Devi Dundoo and Saraswathy Nagarajan)</i></p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/xzq017/article65317550.ece/alternates/FREE_660/beasst6.jpg\" alt=\"Vijay and Pooja Hegde in ‘Beast’\" title=\"Vijay and Pooja Hegde in ‘Beast’\" source=\"SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT\" width=\"660\"/>","section_id":"1"},{"article_id":"41","company":"The Hindu","img_url":"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/ktykwi/article65324747.ece/alternates/FREE_660/IMG_8326.jpeg","location":"","title":"Indian","section":"Education","created_at":"2022-04-18 12:26:52","description":"<div class=\"articleLead\"> From garam masala made with Madagascar spices to fritters stuffed with prawns and béchamel sauce, local meals in Mauritius are familiar yet so exotic </div><h5 class=\"f5 ttu secondary ma0\">Weekend Travel Special 2022 | </h5> <p>It’s a glorious autumn night in April in Mauritius when a small bus with disco lights and local Sega music drops us off in a village named after <i >piment</i> (chilli, in Mauritian Creole). We are at the house of Ved Bhujun, whose forefathers had set sail from India almost 200 years ago to this blue-green land.</p><p>The Bhujun family has retained its Indian heritage, despite a very mixed Creole gene pool now. A temple guards the home’s garden, we are welcomed with lit lamps, and Ved’s son — with the Indian Navy till a few years ago, and now in Mauritius’ anti-narcotics squad — tells me how, when he gets married, he will have not only Indian-style music and dancing but also a “turmeric ceremony”. There is nothing religious about these rituals; they are just vehicles for memories. As is the food. You realise as you taste it, here’s something that is Indianish, but not Indian — spices sans pungency, cultural resonances reshaped into new flavours. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/ktykwi/article65324747.ece/alternates/FREE_660/IMG_8326.jpeg\" alt=\"Ved Bhujun’s son with the writer\" title=\"Ved Bhujun’s son with the writer\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> Coolies to Creole </h2><p>In Mauritius, the heritage of Indian forefathers who had arrived on ships as indentured labourers to work in the European-owned sugar cane farms and mills in the mid 19th century, lives on, revered.</p><p>With slavery abolished after the French Revolution, and Britain trumping its rival maritime colonial power of the time, France, labour began to be contracted from all over India in 1834, and 41,000 Bengali ‘coolies’ landed in this Indian Ocean island. More came in the subsequent years — from Bihar and Andhra, the central provinces, and the southwestern coast; poor Indians searching for better wages, across the ocean and continent, their homeland lost.</p><p>As they settled, they mingled with other immigrants, those from Africa, China, the Malay, as also the Creole born on the island. As races mixed, Bhojpuri and Telugu seeped into Mauritian Creole, and these are the words we hear everywhere: <i >chatni</i> and <i >baija</i> (from <i >bhajiya</i>) being just two liberally served up this evening, as Ved cooks for us in his home. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/brjesb/article65324741.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Baija.jpg\" alt=\"A plate of baijas\" title=\"A plate of baijas\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>Snacks are what he calls “half moons”, shaped much like the Goan <i >rissoi</i>, filled with prawns and bechamel sauce, as well as “chilli bites”, a descendent of the <i >moong dal pakori</i> (fritters) of old Delhi or Madhya Pradesh, spiked with green chillies. These are part of the large <i >baija</i> repertoire of the island, fried everywhere, with anything from potatoes and white onions to lettuce. </p><p>Ved’s lavish home cooked meal moves on to the mains and as a nephew <i >belos</i> (rolls) <i >paratas</i>, there are several curries to be tried — chicken, fish but also chayote (a thin-skinned squash similar to pumpkin), all fragrant and full of spices, but not really pungent with either the black pepper or red chillies of India.</p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/s0bdt3/article65324743.ece/alternates/FREE_660/1649944115558.jpg\" alt=\"Dinner at the Bhujuns\" title=\"Dinner at the Bhujuns\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>It’s a lavish spread set in an open verandah that functions both as a kitchen and dining area, and merges into a beautiful garden.

Ved works with the hotel and dinners such as this — which you may book either via the hotels or independently — cost just around Mauritian Rs 700 per head (approx ₹1,225), plus transport.</p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/5uib9c/article65324753.ece/alternates/FREE_660/1649944115548.jpg\" alt=\"A home cooked Mauritian meal\" title=\"A home cooked Mauritian meal\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>There are similar local dining experiences all over the island, with home cooks, and even former hoteliers or chefs now curating small, personalised experiences to showcase their unique melange of a culture. Indians are excitedly welcomed everywhere thanks to older bonds, and everywhere we go, we land up discussing masala or <i >garam </i>masala (made here with Madagascar spices) and how this is “like India, but not exactly”. In fact, even French-style <i >jus</i> and brown sauces in dishes like grilled chicken sometimes come spiked with <i >garam</i> masala. I ate pizza with tamarind chutney reminiscent of Indian <i >chaat</i> at one popular establishment, too! Apparently this combination is perfectly acceptable on an island where all definitions of ‘original’ are rightly put to rest, such is the diversity and composite-ness of culture. </p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> An imaginative table </h2><p>Small restaurants like Karay Mario, set up by the eponymous Mario, a 60-plus retired hotelier, in an erstwhile apothecary that treated sugar mill workers once upon a time, also give you a full taste of Mauritius’ Indian heritage. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/5b0a10/article65324732.ece/alternates/FREE_660/image0%20%281%29.jpeg\" alt=\"Mario of Karay Mario\" title=\"Mario of Karay Mario\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>Karay, a play on <i >karahi</i> or wok, serves a range of fried <i >gazaks</i> (the generic Arabic word for snacks is the Mauritian word too, pointing to global trade links) that also includes <i >sambusa</i> and <i >dholl puri</i> (lentil <i >puris</i>), apart from the <i >baija</i> and curries.</p><p>Franco-Mauritian families have also incorporated some of these flavours into their own culinary culture, with slight twists. Chilli bites thus become <i >gateaux piments</i>, literally chilli cakes, though the French families, who still own many of the large estates producing sugar cane, vanilla and other fruit, barely use any chilli. The culinary exchange between European and Asian styles of cooking also means that delicacies such as sea urchin or octopus of cold breakfasts as well as the smoked blue marlin and other seafood take more imaginative forms, too. At Mario’s, there is a fabulous octopus and breadfruit curry. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/g9cya3/article65324745.ece/alternates/FREE_660/ved%20%281%29.jpg\" alt=\"Ved with his fish biryani\" title=\"Ved with his fish biryani\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>At Ved’s home, however, we find the most unique fish <i >biryani</i>. He takes some salted fish that reminds me of Macau’s <i >baccala</i> (salted cod; though this is the local <i >sunuk</i>), boils it, then fries it with onions, garlic and tomatoes, tosses it with rice and <i >garam</i> masala to give us <i >biryani</i>-meets-fried rice.</p><p>In essence, this is Mauritius. More than the sum of its many parts. A unique microcosm of the world, connected through trade, history, and politics. A convergence of race and tastes.</p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/bxv5i3/article65324749.ece/alternates/FREE_660/1649944115567.jpg\" alt=\"Platters of chilli bites and half moons\" title=\"Platters of chilli bites and half moons\" source=\"\" width=\"660\"/>","section_id":"11"},{"article_id":"40","company":"The Hindu","img_url":"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/4556ea/article65324522.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Faiz%20Rashid%20%281%29%20copy.jpg","location":"","title":"priyadarshini","section":"Opinion","created_at":"2022-04-18 12:26:24","description":"<p>Tall marble pillars frame photos, automobiles and more, as the Bhopal royals open up their past at the Jehan Numa Palace Hotel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weekend Travel Special 2022 |</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, the Jehan Numa Palace in Bhopal &mdash; built on the slopes of the Shyamla Hills in 1890 by General Obaidullah Khan, commander-in-chief of the Bhopal State Force, and the second son of Nawab Sultan Jehan Begum &mdash; has worn many garbs. The white marble edifice, which melds British Colonial, Italian Renaissance and Classical Greek architectural styles with facets of Art Deco, was constructed as the general&rsquo;s office, and then used as his sons&rsquo; secretariat. After Independence, it became a government hostel, and later, the offices of the Geological Survey of India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1983, after restoring the five-acre property, the general&rsquo;s grandsons reopened it as a heritage hotel &mdash; its colonnaded corridors showcasing sepia-toned portraits, and the interiors housing rooms, four restaurants, two bars and a spa. Now, the pandemic has given it another facet: a museum, which came together almost like a &ldquo;jigsaw puzzle&rdquo;, says Faiz Rashid, director of the Jehan Numa Group of Hotels and a member of the Bhopal royal family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Faiz Rashid\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/4556ea/article65324522.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Faiz%20Rashid%20%281%29%20copy.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>A colonnaded showcase</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;[Over the last 20-odd months] we tried to come up with innovative ways to nurture hospitality. Because of the time on hand, we started looking at family archives and thought why not share the legacy with the world,&rdquo; says Rashid. He tells me about putting together memorabilia: artefacts, attire, &ldquo;lovely letters in Urdu&rdquo; written to his great grandfather, documents, &ldquo;invoices of the cars the royal family bought [like a Ford Phantom and a customised Bentley]&rdquo; &mdash; all of which are now on show at the hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;General Obaidullah Khan accompanied his mother, the last <em>begum</em>, on her foreign trips. He was inspired by different architectural styles, and the display is a pictorial history of the hotel&rsquo;s evolution from the time it was built in the 19th century,&rdquo; he says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The begum’s photo from the archives\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/7m71g5/article65324550.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Begum%20Black%20and%20White%20copy.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The corridors along the central courtyard, with its famed 100-year-old mango tree, were chosen as the ideal backdrop for the display. I take a virtual tour of the elegantly-framed archives, arranged in clusters on the walls of the chequered black-and-white marble and granite corridors, zooming into the photographs, and taking in glimpses of the life and times of a pre-Independence royalty that was progressive and involved, wealthy but not flamboyant, stylish but never garish.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>From letters to thoroughbreds</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The family took the help of Joe Alvarez, the well-known jazz singer who has written a coffee-table book on Bhopal, to curate the memorabilia. &ldquo;We divided them into nine subjects, starting with the four <em>begums</em>, the last <em>nawab</em>, dignitary visits, <em>nawabi</em> sports and the outdoors, and such,&rdquo; says Alvarez, who has also generated a voice-over, and added a QR code to enable a Walk-In Museum audio guide. He expounds about the images of a thriving stud farm, something that continues till date (a trotting track set up when the hotel opened gives visitors a peek into the royal family&rsquo;s passion for breeding thoroughbreds), of custom-built automobiles, branded guns and weapons, and official visits by dignitaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The track at the Jehan Numa Palace Hotel\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/chwk87/article65324525.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Equestrian%20experience%20.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The <em>nawab begums</em> of Bhopal were very dynamic and built the city differently from male rulers. They focussed on all areas, from education to women&rsquo;s empowerment. We realised so much of their contribution &mdash; like building hospitals, enhancing the railways, opening schools &mdash; while putting this together,&rdquo; shares Rashid, adding that, in 1889, Shah Jehan Begum funded the construction of Britain&rsquo;s first purpose-built mosque at Woking. The collection is still evolving as more memorabilia makes its way to them slowly, from the extended family. A plan to restore and display the wedding dresses of the <em>begums</em> is also in the pipeline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The museum is open to all. Rooms at the hotel are from ₹8,000 onwards.

Four rooms of the bungalow will also have walls painted by a local artist, with themes inspired by the natural heritage of the region. Gohil &mdash; a student of archaeology and a history buff, who started the Bhavnagar Heritage Walks in 2018 and spearheaded the restoration of many architecturally-rich buildings in the area &mdash; believes the bungalow&rsquo;s remoteness is its USP and will attract star gazers, nature lovers and bird watchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Belgadia Palace\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/7xzhgr/article65324602.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Belgadia%20Palace.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Barn</strong>, Belgadia Palace, Odisha</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A surprising influx of domestic travellers during the pandemic made Mrinalika Bhanj Deo, a royal descendant of the former princely state of Mayurbhanj, decide to expand what&rsquo;s on offer at The Belgadia Palace.

From closing down the Sydney Opera House, the Hagia Sophia, the Louvre, the Great Sphinx of Giza, Machu Picchu, and the Taj for an exclusive visit, to working with local partners to build luxury camps for her clients, she is not your average travel agent. For this Beverly Hills-based ‘super travel agent’, catering to presidents, billionaires, studio heads and celebrities such as Mariah Carey is a routine day.</p><p>India fell in love with luxury hospitality during her college years. While studying art history at Philadelphia’s Temple University, she worked at the now closed Michelin-starred restaurant, Le Bec Fin. “I got an understanding of the amazing level of knowledge and personal touch that accompanied the service. That was a learning ground,” says India, who established her boutique travel company, Sienna Charles, in 2008. Since then it has transformed into a lifestyle concierge firm, with members from the $100 million club (who, according to reports pay between $75,000 and $150,000 a year).</p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/vvqys/article65324658.ece/alternates/FREE_660/1fa25fac72c685dd07c0bd61604bf5f6.jpg\" alt=\"Luxury properties from Sienna Charles\" title=\"Luxury properties from Sienna Charles\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> What money can buy </h2><p>Having travelled to 90 countries — she’s on the road 200 days a year, personally vetting every location, yacht, villa and restaurant she recommends to her clients — India prides herself in going the extra mile for her clients. “When I take on a new client, I meet them in person,” she says. “I see what they look like, what they like to eat, the way they interact with people [I have no hang-ups turning down people who are rude]… We discuss their passions: do they love wine, pursue history, or are they looking at reconnecting with their life or their family. When I understand what their expectation is, I kind of take out my toolbox and create a new experience for them.”</p><p>Like, for example, when former US president George Bush travelled with her to Ethiopia in 2015. She was not satisfied with the accommodation on offer, so her team purchased brand new furniture, bedding and sheets, and built beautiful accommodations from scratch. “I’ll never accept a no if I can do one better. I know what the preferences of my clients are and I fight for them before they even arrive,” she says. “When you are willing to spend, it all gets a little easier to get the things you want.” </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/n6zo59/article65324697.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Untitled%20design.png\" alt=\"The Great Pyramid of Giza\" title=\"The Great Pyramid of Giza\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>Little wonder that she closed down monuments in Egypt for a world leader, or covered the entire floor of a private villa with exotic ‘Cherry Snow’ roses flown in from Ecuador for a client’s wife’s birthday. On another occasion, she arranged a private breakfast on the top of the Arc De Triomphe in Paris, and across the Atlantic Ocean, worked with movie set producers and styling experts to create a cinematic Parisian scene in the heart of Miami, where famed chef Eric Ripert designed a special menu. “Nothing is a weird request anymore.”</p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> Relationships, not transactions </h2><p>India’s journey with her clients (“there is always a waiting list”) never ends with the completion of a tour. “We become family. We have personal-professional relationships spanning a decade or so,” she says. Recently, when she visited a new Indian restaurant in London, she called up one of her clients famous for his love of Indian food and asked him to check out the place for the authentic cuisine it offered. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/ri6ii9/article65324692.ece/alternates/FREE_660/B0008682-Edit-2.jpg\" alt=\"Jaclyn Sienna India\" title=\"Jaclyn Sienna India\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>“It’s a very collaborative relationship that I cultivate,” she says, explaining that her clients usually stay on with her for years. “It naturally gets easier to cater to them after the first trip. If there is a place that we decide on which I haven’t explored earlier, I make it a point to go on a recce. I’ve spent time on the ground hand-picking the hotels, tasting the food at the restaurants, and finding unique personalities to take my clients around on their visits,” she says. “Of course, there have also been times when I’ve come back and said, ‘It’s not a fit, I think we should find somewhere else to go.’ My clients have always trusted my decisions.”</p><p> <b >Roadblocks and family time</b></p><p>The pandemic, has brought with it its own set of challenges. Be it getting into a restaurant or a hotel, or even a country, there is paperwork and problems, she rues. “We have had families in the US who want to travel with a private chef. And that’s a challenge because private chefs are in short supply.” But demand for more meaningful experiences is also going up. There is a focus on wellness, with requests coming in for detox resorts and <i >yogi</i> masters. And as she recently told barrons.com, “Yachting is the most popular it has been. Clients sometimes pay $100,000 to $300,000 a week and bring their multi-generational family for a trip.”</p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/q6p19/article65324667.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Screenshot%202022-04-15%20211152.png\" alt=\"Offshore escapes\" title=\"Offshore escapes\" source=\"@siennacharles\" width=\"100%\"/> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> Post-pandemic trends </h2><p>* People are buying assets — jets, villas, yachts, vacation homes — instead of renting them.

The podcast host (@theshahzadalife on Instagram) started travelling full-time in 2017 and has already ticked off places like Albania, Serbia, Laos and Cambodia on his travel checklist. Now, post-pandemic, Arora is more the rule than the exception. In his podcast, <em>Remote Explorers</em>, he shares why he thinks the digital nomad trend is no less than a revolution of sorts. &ldquo;Earlier, someone living in a village had to travel to a city to get an education, then to a bigger city for an internship, and finally an even bigger one for a job. Today, you could sit in a village and work for a company in Silicon Valley!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Shahzada Arora\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/aw3q7e/article65324967.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Shahzada%20Arora.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Needless to say, companies and countries are helping to facilitate this. Barbados was one of the first to provide a 12-month Welcome Stamp-a visa in June 2020. Malta, Iceland, Australia, Croatia and many others followed soon after (Italy and Spain are likely to introduce a digital nomad visa this year). There are even digital nomad villages popping up in places like Madeira, in Portugal, and the Canary Islands (some to shore up declining tourist numbers, and others to combat their rural depopulation crisis).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/mgpt6x/article65326914.ece/alternates/FREE_660/1.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the midst of all this movement, what many forget is the toll the lifestyle can take. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t take long for [my boyfriend] Paul and I to realise that the instability of digital nomad life added an extra challenge to working full-time on the road,&rdquo; says Brittany Sneller, a travel blogger (<a href=\"https://bucketlistbri.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bucketlist Bri</a>). &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just one reason, among others, that we prioritise slow travel &mdash; living and travelling for extended periods in one destination, as opposed to jet setting or moving often. That said, we still work &lsquo;set&rsquo; hours during the week; typically from 7 am to 6 pm. The difference of our nomad lifestyle versus a 9-5 office job is that we get the luxury and freedom of choice. To choose when we want to work or play.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we asked a few nomads &mdash; both newbies and those with experience &mdash; for a nomad lifestyle 101.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Himanshi Shah in Mexico\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/2vhhrk/article65324937.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Himanshi-Mexico.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Himanshi Shah, 28</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Working from Mexico since 2020 | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nomadictravelscapes/\" target=\"_blank\">@nomadictravelscapes</a> on Instagram</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;One month into my first-ever full-time job and I knew I couldn&rsquo;t work with someone breathing down my neck constantly,&rdquo; says Shah, who now works as a graphic designer for a German restaurant and, parallelly, runs a travel blog. She first made her way out of India in 2017, when she went to Japan on a volunteer programme. And she still abides by a lesson she picked up there &mdash; to be with people. &ldquo;You need at least two good friends or acquaintances in every city you go to. Use Instagram to connect with people even before you arrive, to know how things work locally. Earlier, I wasn&rsquo;t open to talking to strangers. But with this lifestyle, I can&rsquo;t do without it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Network and connect:</strong> Friends are great to fall back on for help in times of need. &ldquo;Take a gift from your town, build a connection with locals. Even Reddit is a brilliant platform to get advice. Just go through the profile of the person you&rsquo;re interacting with online for credibility.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Himanshi Shah\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/lyr9z5/article65324939.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Himanshi-desk2%202.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Learn the language:</strong> It can help you network better and land jobs. &ldquo;At the same time, Google Translate will be your best friend as a digital nomad.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get a local SIM:</strong> &ldquo;Every place that I&rsquo;ve been to outside of India offers tourists SIM cards [for periods ranging from seven days to a month].&rdquo; Shah suggests logging onto klook.com to cover the basics, from hiring the first taxi ride from the airport to getting a SIM card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Develop a passive income stream:</strong> &ldquo;I offer print-on-demand services and sell my photos on T-shirts, mugs and posters. People can experiment with photography, e-books or vlogs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Recommended places: Mexico, Thailand</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Thirumal Motati\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/orumfa/article65324945.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Vietnam-Dalat-Annas-Coffee.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Thirumal Motati, 41</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Working from Georgia since 2022 | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/visatraveler/\" target=\"_blank\">@visatraveler</a> on Instagram</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, when Motati was working as a programmer in the US, he was advised to return to India when his visa expired. Instead, he chose to spend three months in Mexico and another month in Canada. &ldquo;I realised I was productive irrespective of where I worked from,&rdquo; he says, adding that while his employer back then wasn&rsquo;t convinced about the idea, things have now changed. Motati runs a travel visa-themed blog (visatraveler.com). While working on the go can bring freedom to choose work timings and explore things you enjoy, global realities today bring with them a grey side as well. &ldquo;You often are left without a support system. For example, I was stuck in Vietnam for over a year because of the pandemic. That&rsquo;s when the local community of digital nomads and expats really comes to your rescue.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Join a group:</strong> Try places like nomadlist.io to engage with local communities of digital nomads. &ldquo;You can even find city-specific Facebook groups. Identify one with the largest number of members, start fresh conversations there, and go through previous discussions to learn about a destination.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Thirumal Motati in Vietnam\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/5fd7yh/article65324946.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Vietnam-Dalat-Nhalong-Coffee.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get a US visa:</strong> &ldquo;It will get you free access to many countries [and it&rsquo;s for 10 years]. It may get difficult to get the visa once you leave your job, so apply for it while you&rsquo;re still working full time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Have multiple bank accounts:</strong> &ldquo;Before you start travelling, get yourself two to three bank accounts and credit cards, in case any get blocked or stolen. If you can manage it, try and get bank accounts in multiple countries, or get a borderless account on WISE.&rdquo; Similarly, signing up for a PayPal or Payoneer accounts can be handy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Recommended places: Danang in Vietnam, Mexico City in Mexico, Chiang Mai in Thailand, Bali in Indonesia, Tbilisi in Georgia, and Medell&iacute;n in Colombia.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/m8i8d8/article65324949.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Santhosh%20Thirumavalavan.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Santhosh Thirumavalavan, 27</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Currently in Bengaluru, and headed to Himachal Pradesh next month | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/craytographer/\" target=\"_blank\">@craytographer</a> on Instagram</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirumavalavan, a software engineer, first started venturing into cafes in Bengaluru to get a taste of working remotely.

After graduating from college in 2015, I moved to Kathmandu, Nepal for my studies and a job, and Paul followed suit. Fast forward three years &mdash; through moving around Europe, South America, and eventually receiving my MA in Humanitarian Aid &mdash; we decided to &lsquo;move to&rsquo; Mexico, basing ourselves in a small beach town on the west coast for six months&hellip; and by the time we went full-time nomadic in 2018, we had already been living abroad in different countries around the world,&rdquo; says Sneller, adding that, post pandemic, her blog traffic &ldquo;has grown beyond my imagination and I am able to earn from it full-time&rdquo;. Travelling with Paul and her eight-year-old cat Yoda, she plans to overland Canada, the US, and parts of Mexico in their 1990 Roadtrek van this year. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re never too sure where we will be in the next six months!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do your research:</strong> Look into where you want to go, what the culture is like, what the community is like, and the overall lifestyle. &ldquo;Being prepared before you arrive really helps to mitigate any anxiety or stress.

These are family-run eateries serving simple local food at reasonable prices with daily menus reflecting what is available in local markets.</p><p>With no tourists for the last two years, small eateries have emerged in the lanes of the not-so-fashionable districts of Venice and on some of its lesser-known islands. Even some luxury hotels, like the Aman, famous for hosting the Clooney wedding, are following suit. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/6gr2w2/article65324852.ece/alternates/FREE_660/cichetti.png\" alt=\"Baccala mantecato\" title=\"Baccala mantecato\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>Thankfully, Italians continue to hold out nobly against the 10-minute lunch, and so lunch and dinner are proper meals. Look out for old-fashioned starters or <i >cichetti</i> (pronounced <i > chiketti</i>) like <i >baccala mantecato</i> (salt cod whipped till creamy with olive oil), <i >castraure</i> (fresh young artichokes usually served fried), and a whole supporting cast of seafood starring my favourite <i >seppie in nero</i> (large black cuttlefish) served in risotto or with polento to mop up the umami squid ink sauce. For vegetarians, every season produces a bounty of vegetables cooked in creative ways. </p><p>If you plan to drop by — for a holiday or to visit the Venice Biennale (April 23 - November 27) — here is a sampling of where to eat:</p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> Trattoria Bar Pontini </h2><p>A family-run restaurant presided over by Jada and her all-women team, inside you will find workmen in overalls having a coffee and a <i >tramezzino</i>, a local sandwich made with soft white bread generously stuffed with Russian salad or ham. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/2c4g6p/article65324834.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Trattoria%20Bar%20Pontini%203.jpg\" alt=\"Trattoria Bar Pontini\" title=\"Trattoria Bar Pontini\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>Outside is where you need to be, at a table on the canal sidewalk in between a (non-smelly) fish stall and an old tobacconist. Try the <i >fritto misto</i>, the seafood spaghetti and the seafood antipasti. Regulars come here to either eat or take-away the meatballs called <i >polpetti</i>, sort of flattish cutlets made out of tuna or meat. I love the local vibe here, the reasonable prices and big portions. Avoid weekends when tourists hover. Pontini is a five-minute walk from the railway station and the busy shopping street known as Strada Nova.</p><p> <i >Details: @trattoriapontini on Instagram</i></p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> Trattoria Da Ignazio </h2><p>This is a restaurant, with a delightful indoor courtyard and fairly spacious seating, recommended by a Venetian friend who has been coming here for years. Started in 1951 by Ignazio and his son Fiorenzo Scroccaro who runs it today, the menu goes beyond the usual seafood and stretches to seasonal vegetables, salads, as well as steak and plates of thinly sliced Parma ham. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/eu5nu7/article65324802.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Trattoria%20Da%20Ignazio.jpg\" alt=\"Fiorenzo Scroccaro\" title=\"Fiorenzo Scroccaro\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>The Fegato alla Veneziana, liver braised with onions and vinegar, is quite simply delicious.

The star is the ink squid cuttlefish packed with flavour. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/smr75d/article65324821.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Untitled%20design%20%282%29.png\" alt=\"Osteria Ai 4 Feri Storti and its popular fritto misto\" title=\"Osteria Ai 4 Feri Storti and its popular fritto misto\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>Betty and Barbara (there are pictures of them on the wall) started it and the woman who single-handedly runs the whole restaurant and serves, has been here for over 20 years. It seats 24 inside with four tables outside by the bridge in a charming setting. The kitchen closes at 2.30 pm after lunch. Easy to find just off the Campo Aponal in San Polo near the San Silvestro stop, it also has some impressive wines.</p><p> <i >Details: Osteria Ai 4 feri Storti on Facebook</i></p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/pyz6kp/article65324794.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Rosa%20Salva%201.jpg\" alt=\"Rosa Salva caffè\" title=\"Rosa Salva caffè\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> Rosa Salva </h2><p>One of the oldest caffès in Venice started in the 1870s, it is still a family business operating another flagship one on the mainland and a rollicking catering business. Its incongruous exterior on the lovely San Giovanni e Paolo square in the district of Castello, near the <i >vaporetto</i> stop Fondamente Nove, doesn’t look special at all but Rosa Salva has a huge reputation with the locals. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/urdjg7/article65324795.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Rosa%20Salva%202.jpg\" alt=\"Try sandwiches and a glass of wine at Rosa Salva\" title=\"Try sandwiches and a glass of wine at Rosa Salva\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>A pastry shop which also sells snacks, <i >tramezzini</i> sandwiches and drinks (the alcoholic variety), its specialties include hot chocolate with zaletti biscuits, frozen <i >zabaglione</i> with Venetian <i >baicoli</i> cookies and <i >fritole</i>, a soft-fried dough filled with apple and raisins or <i >zabaglione</i>. Their <i >bigne</i> filled with pistachio cream are to die for. It really is a great place to stop, pause, people watch and grab a sandwich for a few euros, if the seagulls don’t swoop down on it, that is. </p><p> <i >Details: rosasalva.it</i></p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> Arva at Aman Venice </h2><p>What’s not to love about the Aman, a 16th century palace painstakingly restored to its former glory? Its restaurant, Arva, is a tribute to Italy’s rich culinary heritage. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/kntjbq/article65324827.ece/alternates/FREE_660/1650040807456.jpg\" alt=\"Arva at Aman Venice\" title=\"Arva at Aman Venice\" source=\"@aman_venice\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>Chef Matteo and consultant chef Norbert work with local farmers, fishermen, and niche suppliers to secure the freshest Adriatic fish, single-source olive oils from Tuscany and Liguria, artisanal pasta, and market produce.

Take a trip to Chioggia, an island where real Venetians live and which is reachable from the mainland and from Venice by car or bus… and of course by boat. It’s like a mini Venice with canals but without the tourists and the 15th century palaces. Other things going for it are the extraordinary fish market which supplies most of Venice’s restaurants, a lively weekly market on a Thursday and the oldest working clock tower in the world. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/33aq6z/article65324784.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Untitled%20design.png\" alt=\"Tables overlooking the many canals, and the restaurant’s seafood antipasti\" title=\"Tables overlooking the many canals, and the restaurant’s seafood antipasti\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>I have been coming to the restaurant Alberto Capo for over 10 years and the food just keeps getting better. His ink squid risotto, seafood antipasti platter and the <i >fritto misto</i>, are all must-haves. Do try the Ribolla Gialla which is both an inexpensive and lesser-known white wine from Friuli with a salty mineral finish which grows on you. Young Alberto tells me he didn’t suffer much during Covid because Italians come to this restaurant both from the mainland and from Venice.</p><p> <i >Details: ristorante-alberto-capo.business.site</i></p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> La Taverna </h2><p>Felice and Nadia own and run this trattoria with menus in German and English as well. It’s on a bylane off the main street of Chioggia. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/jwioz/article65324785.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Untitled%20design%20%281%29.png\" alt=\"Felice and Nadia of La Taverna\" title=\"Felice and Nadia of La Taverna\" source=\"\" width=\"100%\"/> <p>I am not convinced about the homely décor –quirky family memorabilia — but the place is packed with locals eating spaghetti with mussels, seafood antipasti and ink squid ravioli.

The economic crisis also triggered a political turmoil in the island nation with citizens holding nationwide street protests for weeks over lengthy power cuts and shortage of fuel, food and other daily essentials and demanding ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier this month, Sri Lanka&#39;s entire Cabinet &mdash; aside from President Gotabaya and his elder brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa &mdash; resigned from their posts after thousands of people defied a countrywide state of emergency and curfew and joined street protests denouncing the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to sources, President Gotabaya has made arrangements to swear in a smaller Cabinet anytime soon. It will not feature any member of the Rajapaksa family other than Prime Minister Mahinda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Gotabaya had fired his brother and finance minister Basil Rajapaksa from his post earlier this month and invited the Opposition parties to join a unity Cabinet to tackle the raging public anger against the hardships caused by the economic crisis. The Opposition rejected the offer to form a unity Cabinet.

The Russian military said Sunday that it had attacked an ammunition plant near Kyiv overnight with precision-guided missiles, the third such strike in as many days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia&rsquo;s stepped-up attacks on Kyiv came after it accused Ukraine on Thursday of wounding seven people and damaging about 100 residential buildings with airstrikes in Bryansk, a region bordering Ukraine. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed hitting targets in Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a Saturday strike on what Russia&#39;s Defense Ministry identified as an armored vehicle plant killed one person and wounded several. He advised residents who fled the city earlier in the war not to return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Russian military also claimed Sunday to have destroyed Ukrainian air defense radars in the east, near Sievierodonetsk, as well as several ammunition depots elsewhere. Explosions were reported overnight in Kramatorsk, an eastern city where rockets killed at least 57 people at a train station crowded with civilians trying to evacuate before the expected Russian offensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ongoing siege and relentless bombardment of Mariupol has come at a terrible cost, with officials estimating Russians had killed at least 21,000 people. Just 120,000 people remain in the city, out of a prewar population of 450,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Malyar, the deputy defense minister, said the Russians have continued to hit Mariupol with airstrikes and could be getting ready for an amphibious landing to beef up their ground forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capturing the city with a land area about half the size of Hong Kong&rsquo;s and home to a Sea of Azov port would also allow Russia to secure a land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, tunnels at the sprawling Azovstal steel mill, which covers an area of more than 11 square kilometers (over 4.2 square miles), have allowed the defenders to hide and resist until they run out of ammunition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Russia apparently poised to declare victory, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the city&rsquo;s fall could scuttle any attempt at a negotiated peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The destruction of all our guys in Mariupol &mdash; what they are doing now &mdash; can put an end to any format of negotiations,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said in an interview with Ukrainian journalists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his nightly address to the nation, Mr. Zelenskyy called on the West to send more heavy weapons immediately if there is any chance of saving the city, adding Russia &ldquo;is deliberately trying to destroy everyone who is there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer, who met with Vladimir Putin this past week in Moscow &mdash; the first European leader to do so since the invasion began Feb. 24 &mdash; said the Russian president is &ldquo;in his own war logic&rdquo; on Ukraine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview on NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meet the Press,&rdquo; Nehammer said he thinks Putin believes he is winning the war and &ldquo;we have to look in his eyes and we have to confront him with that, what we see in Ukraine.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nehammer said he told Putin what he saw during a visit to the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where more than 350 bodies have been found along with evidence of killings and torture under Russian occupation, and &ldquo;it was not a friendly conversation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Mariupol, the northeast city of Kharkiv has been an ongoing target of Russian aggression.

Ramana has been heard, time and again, telling lawyers in open court about the challenges of listing every case early. The Supreme Court has only recently resumed full physical hearings after two years of virtual system. The court is juggling Benches, judges are sitting in different combinations on Special Benches to quickly hear and dispose of pending matters, including death penalty cases. The court is seeing a flurry of action. Seven impending retirements in seven months may slow the recovery at a crucial time. Adding to this is the fact that there are already two vacancies. The working judicial strength is 32 against the sanctioned strength of 34.</p><p>The row of monthly retirements would start from the very month the court goes into its summer recess.</p><p>Justice Vineet Saran would retire on May 10 and Justice L. Nageswara Rao and Justice A.M. Khanwilkar on June 7 and July 29 respectively. Chief Justice Ramana would retire on August 26. Justice Indira Banerjee would exit office on September 23 — reducing the number of women judges from four to three — followed by Justice Hemant Gupta on October 16. </p><p>Justice Lalit, who is expected as per the seniority norm to be appointed Chief Justice after Justice Ramana’s retirement, would retire on November 8.

Justice Ramana’s successor, Justice Lalit has a little over two months as top judge. So, either Chief Justice Ramana’s especially successful Collegium, which scripted the prospective appointment of India’s first woman Chief Justice in Justice B.V.

This is the first summit hosted by China since the tensions broke out at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) due to the PLA’s transgressions in April 2020. </p><p>Ahead of this year’s summit, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Delhi last month, which was seen as possibly heralding a gradual normalisation of ties.

It is unclear whether PM Modi, who is already travelling for a bilateral meeting to Germany on May 1, is on the list of special invitees to the G-7 summit, which is still being prepared, officials said.</p><p>Meanwhile, a number of other preparatory meetings hosted for the BRICS summit are underway. In a meeting on April 12, BRICS health ministers including Mansukh Mandaviya held a virtual launch of the “BRICS Vaccine R&amp;D Centre” to conduct “vaccine joint research, plant co-construction, authorised local production, and mutual recognition of standards”, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. On Tuesday, counter-terrorism officials will meet to discuss “targeted Financial Sanctions Related to Terrorism and Terrorist Financing” during a plenary session.</p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> Trade options </h2><p>Ahead of the summit, Sherpas of the five countries, including MEA Secretary for Multilateral and Economic Relations Dammu Ravi, met virtually on April 12-13, to discuss the dates and format of the meetings ahead. They also discussed the agenda, expected to include the Ukraine conflict, financial mechanisms to deal with sanctions against Russia, and cooperation against the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>In a statement released at the end of the Sherpa’s meetings, the Chinese MFA said BRICS countries clarified a “common position on the Ukraine issue” during the Sherpa meeting chaired by BRICS coordinator and Vice-Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, expressing concern over the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, and support for multilateralism, adherence to the UN Charter, respect for the legitimate security concerns of all countries, and support for continued dialogue between Russia and Ukraine.</p><p>Speaking at the BRICS Finance Ministers meeting earlier this month, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov called for the use of national currencies for BRICS countries, integration of payment systems and cards, their own financial messaging system and the creation of an independent BRICS rating agency. The measures would effectively circumvent some of the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European Union, which none of the BRICS countries have joined.</p><p>While India and China have been engaging through the BRICS framework, on the bilateral front, India’s message to China over the past two years has been that it cannot be “business as usual” with the LAC crisis still unresolved.</p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> Business with Beijing </h2><p>One other area of normalcy is the trade front, where business has been booming. Two-way trade in 2021 reached $125 billion, crossing the $100 billion mark for the first time, driven by India’s imports of Chinese goods, most notably electronic products and chemicals, including Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), which India’s pharma industry relies on.</p><p>Trade figures released last week showed the trend has continued into the new year, despite New Delhi’s avowed intention of diversifying imports and reducing trade with China, with imports in the first quarter of 2022 reaching $31.96 billion, up 15% from last year’s figure, which was itself a record. Since the start of the pandemic, India has also imported more medical supplies from China than any other country.</p><p>India has, however, kept in place measures to closely scrutinise Chinese investments. Chinese private equity and VC investments have fallen below $1 billion for the first time since 2017, according to research firm Venture Intelligence. New Delhi has also scrutinised the financial practices of Chinese companies in India, with the ED carrying out investigations and raids on a number of firms, including Xiaomi, Huawei and Oppo. Last week, the ED summoned Xiaomi’s former India head, and current Global VP, Manu Kumar Jain, over an investigation into whether it had complied with foreign exchange regulations.</p><p>Some investments from China have, however, been cleared. Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Som Parkash told Parliament last month India had received 347 FDI proposals from neighbouring countries since April 2020. Most are thought to be from China or China-linked firms, and of them, 66 had been cleared, while 193 had been rejected or withdrawn. Those cleared included investments in the auto, chemicals and electronics sectors. </p><img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/io6e9n/article65329667.ece/alternates/FREE_660/BRICS-SUMMITLEADERS\" alt=\"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro pose for a photo at the BRICS summit in Brasilia on November 14, 2019. \" title=\"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro pose for a photo at the BRICS summit in Brasilia on November 14, 2019. \" source=\"Reuters\" width=\"660\"/>","section_id":"2"},{"article_id":"28","company":"The Hindu","img_url":"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/oa4j6c/article65329507.ece/alternates/FREE_660/iStock-1304654109.jpg","location":"","title":"Sonam","section":"Business","created_at":"2022-04-18 12:12:24","description":"<div class=\"articleLead\"> What are the powers of the ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act? </div><p> <b >The story so far: </b>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is in the news now and often. It goes back to May 1, 1956, when an ‘Enforcement Unit’ was formed in the Department of Economic Affairs, for handling Exchange Control Laws violations under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA). The ED today is a multi-dimensional organisation investigating economic offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, Foreign Exchange Management Act and FERA.</p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> From where does the ED get its powers? </h2><p>When proceeds of crime (property/money) are generated, the best way to save that money is by parking it somewhere, so one is not answerable to anyone in the country. Therefore, there was a need to control and prevent the laundering of money. The PMLA was brought in for this exact reason in 2002, but was enacted only in 2005. The objective was to prevent parking of the money outside India and to trace out the layering and the trail of money. So as per the Act, the ED got its power to investigate under Sections 48 (authorities under act) and 49 (appointment and powers of authorities and other officers).</p><p>If money has been laundered abroad, the PMLA court (constituted as per the Act) has the right to send a letter of rogatory under Section 105 (reciprocal arrangements regarding processes) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The said government can then share the documents and evidence needed by the agency. The preventive part is to create a deterrent and fear in the minds of people.</p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> At what stage does the ED step in when a crime is committed? </h2><p>Whenever any offence is registered by a local police station, which has generated proceeds of crime over and above ₹1 crore, the investigating police officer forwards the details to the ED. Alternately, if the offence comes under the knowledge of the Central agency, they can then call for the First Information Report (FIR) or the chargesheet if it has been filed directly by police officials. This will be done to find out if any laundering has taken place. </p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> What differentiates the probe between the local police and officers of the ED? </h2><p>Consider the following scenario: If a theft has been committed in a nationalised bank, the local police station will first investigate the crime. If it is learnt that the founder of the bank took all the money and kept it in his house, without being spent or used, then the crime is only theft and the ED won’t interfere because the amount has already been seized. But if the amount which has been stolen is used after four years to purchase some properties, then the ill-gotten money is brought back in the market; or if the money is given to someone else to buy properties in different parts of the country, then there is ‘laundering’ of money and the ED will need to step in and look into the layering and attachment of properties to recover the money. </p><p>If jewellery costing ₹1 crore is stolen, police officers will investigate the theft. The ED, however, will attach assets of the accused to recover the amount of ₹1 crore.</p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> What are the other roles and functions of the ED? </h2><p>The ED carries out search (property) and seizure (money/documents) after it has decided that the money has been laundered, under Section 16 (power of survey) and Section 17 (search and seizure) of the PMLA. On the basis of that, the authorities will decide if arrest is needed as per Section 19 (power of arrest).</p><p>Under Section 50 (powers of authorities regarding summons, production of documents and to give evidence etc), the ED can also directly carry out search and seizure without calling the person for questioning. It is not necessary to summon the person first and then start with the search and seizure. </p><p>If the person is arrested, the ED gets 60 days to file the prosecution complaint (chargesheet) as the punishment under PMLA doesn&#039;t go beyond seven years. If no one is arrested and only the property is attached, then the prosecution complaint along with attachment order is to be submitted before the adjudicating authority within 60 days.</p> <h2 class=\"sub_head\"> The PMLA being relatively new, can the ED investigate cases of money laundering retrospectively? </h2><p> If an ill-gotten property is acquired before the year 2005 (when the law was brought in) and disposed off, then there is no case under PMLA.

The CRPF deploys the largest number of personnel for the yatra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A senior government official said that the yatra saw the arrival of around 6.3 lakh pilgrims in 2011, one of the highest footfalls in a decade, and plans were afoot to scale up the numbers. After the 2016 unrest in the Kashmir Valley, post the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, there had been a steep decline in the number of pilgrims enrolling for the yatra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The year 2018 saw the arrival of 2.85 lakh pilgrims, the highest after the 2016 unrest when hundreds were killed and several injured due to pellet guns. In 2019, the yatra was abruptly called off on August 2, days before the government moved a legislation in Parliament to revoke the applicability of Article 370 of the Constitution in J&amp;K, which granted the former State special status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the number of pilgrims stood at 6.21 lakh, 3.54 lakh, 3.72 lakh and 3.53 lakh respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The <a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jk-govt-cancels-amarnath-yatra-for-this-year/article34886020.ece\" target=\"_self\">yatra was planned in 2021 too but was called off due to rising cases of COVID-19</a>. It could not be held in 2020, again due to the pandemic. This year, preparations are on to make it a grand success,&rdquo; said the official.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another official said that the success of the yatra will be an added feather in the cap for the Centre&rsquo;s effort in improving the security scenario in J&amp;K post-August 2019, when the former State was bifurcated and downgraded into two Union Territories of J&amp;K and Ladakh. J&amp;K has been under Central rule since June 2018 after the PDP-BJP coalition government collapsed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Periodic review meetings are planned in the coming months,&rdquo; said the official.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On April 6, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) informed Parliament that cross-border infiltration in J&amp;K had decreased significantly since 2018 and the &ldquo;net infiltration&rdquo; was down to 34 in 2021. The Ministry said that there had been a substantial decline in terrorist attacks from 417 in 2018 to 255 such incidents in 2019, 244 in 2020 and 229 in 2021.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yatra will commence from the twin routes of Pahalgam in Anantnag district and Baltal in Ganderbal district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, eight people were killed when a bus carrying Amarnath pilgrims from Gujarat was attacked by Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists near Batingoo in Anantnag district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the incident, stringent measures were put in place, which included tagging of vehicles with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). This year, the Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) has been asked to provide RFID tags to pilgrims, unlike previous years, when the CRPF and J&amp;K police had been tasked to do the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The tags are helpful in knowing the precise location of the vehicles as the CRPF and other forces pilot them to the base camp from where the trekking to the holy shrine begins,&rdquo; said another official.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All pilgrims are required to register with the SASB, pay a nominal fee and furnish health records before they are allotted the date and time to travel to undertake the yatra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"People submitting their registration for the Amarnath Yatra to be held in 2022.\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nk9ftk/article65320613.ece/alternates/FREE_660/PTI04_11_2022_000031B.jpg\" style=\"width:660px\" /></p>\r\n","section_id":"2"},{"article_id":"4","company":"The Hindu","img_url":"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/uxrto/article65329862.ece/alternates/FREE_660/6270_17_4_2022_13_35_18_4_COMMUNALCLASHJAHANGIRPURI_17_04_19.JPG","location":"iPad","title":"Article","section":"Business","created_at":"2022-03-02 14:55:53","description":"<p>Cinematic mode adds shallow depth of field and shifts focus automatically in your videos Advanced dual-camera system with 12MP Wide and Ultra Wide cameras; Photographic Styles, Smart HDR 4, Night mode, 4K Dolby Vision HDR recording</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/uxrto/article65329862.ece/alternates/FREE_660/6270_17_4_2022_13_35_18_4_COMMUNALCLASHJAHANGIRPURI_17_04_19.JPG\" alt=\"A scene at Jahangirpuri where a clash was took place on April 16, 2022, evening during Hanuman Jayanti Shobha Yatra between two communities, in New Delhi on April 17, 2022.\" title=\"A scene at Jahangirpuri where a clash was took place on April 16, 2022, evening during Hanuman Jayanti Shobha Yatra between two communities, in New Delhi on April 17, 2022.\" source=\"Sushil Kumar Verma\" width=\"660\"/>\r\n","section_id":"2"},{"article_id":"3","company":"The Hindu","img_url":"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hml5pf/article65320656.ece/alternates/FREE_660/Musk_Twitter_93446.jpg-66e8b.jpg","location":"iPhone","title":"Smartest phone ever","section":"Business","created_at":"2022-03-02 14:55:53","description":"<div class=\"articleLead\"> Twitter's shares jumped 12% in premarket trading </div><p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/business/elon-musk-sued-over-delay-in-disclosing-twitter-stake/article65316863.ece\" target=\"_self\" >Billionaire Elon Musk</a> has offered to buy Twitter for about $41 billion, just days after rejecting a seat on the social media company&#039;s board.</p><p>Mr. Musk&#039;s offer price of $54.20 per share, which was disclosed in a regulatory filing on Thursday, represents a 38% premium to Twitter&#039;s April 1 close, the last trading day before the Tesla CEO&#039;s more than 9% stake in the company was made public.</p><p>Twitter&#039;s shares jumped 12% in premarket trading.</p><p>&quot;Since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form.

Musk’s latest trouble with the SEC could be his delay in notifying regulators of his growing stake in Twitter.</p><p>Mr. Musk has described himself as a “free speech absolutist” and has said he doesn’t think Twitter is living up to free speech principles — an opinion shared by followers of Donald Trump and a number of other right-wing political figures who’ve had their accounts suspended for violating Twitter content rules.</p><p>Here is a summary of analyst comments: </p><p> <b >BEN LAIDLER, GLOBAL MARKETS STRATEGIST, eToro:</b></p><p>&quot;Musk’s offer of $54.20 per share is a punchy 38% higher than when he disclosed his initial stake but is still 30% below the share price highs of last year.

quarantine in a well-ventilated room stocked with masks, sanitizer and other gear &mdash; raised hopes that the central quarantine rule might be relaxed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, when asked by a social media user in an online comments section about who might be eligible for home quarantine, the CDC referred to the old rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shanghai authorities also gave no hint of any change in approach during a Thursday briefing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Testing patience</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-anger-grows-over-shanghai-lockdown-amid-food-shortages-surge-in-cases/article65308437.ece\" target=\"_self\">On Wednesday, Mr. Xi said during a visit to south China&#39;s Hainan island</a> that China must stick to its strict &quot;dynamic COVID clearance&quot;

India, the agency said at a press briefing on Thursday, would get 99% of the Long Period Average (LPA). The LPA was 89 cm until 2018and was changed to 88 cm that year. In 2022, this has been again updated to 87 cm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A monsoon is considered &lsquo;normal&rsquo; when it falls between 96%-104% of the LPA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The definition of the LPA, said M Mohapatra, Director General, IMD, is meant to be updated every decade. The 89 cm average was computed based on a 50-year average from 1951-2000, the 88 cm based on 1961-2010 and the latest based 1971-2020. When seen over a century, the average rainfall changes every decade with roughly thirty years of a declining trend followed by thirty years of an upswing, said Mohapatra. &ldquo;Currently India is at the end of a dry epoch and we seem to be entering a wet epoch. The next update will be after a decade.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weather station data historically used to be delayed but now the IMD had moved to an automated system that provided real time data from close to 5,000 stations compared to the 1,000-odd from even a decade ago. &ldquo;We have now updated all of this and therefore are able to provide these updated numbers (of LPA),&rdquo; he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Current indications suggest &lsquo;normal&rsquo; to &lsquo;above normal&rsquo; seasonal rainfall in northern parts of peninsular India, Central India and the Himalayan foothills a. Many parts of Northeast India and southern parts of South India are expected to see subdued monsoons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IMD doesn&rsquo;t expect an El Nino, a phenomenon associated with a warming of the Central Pacific and drying up rains over northwest India, to form during the monsoon months. &ldquo;Currently La Nina conditions are prevailing over equatorial Pacific. The latest forecasts indicates it will continue during the monsoon.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IMD&rsquo;s April forecast doesn&rsquo;t indicate if some monsoon months will experience below normal rains, or regional variations. This information is expected by May-end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Tuesday, private weather forecasting agency, Skymet, too forecast monsoon 2022 to be &lsquo;normal&rsquo; adding that rainfall in August, the second rainiest month, will likely be subdued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the consequences of climate change are alterations to the monsoon. There are increased stretches of dry spells followed by spells of intense rain. However officials says that while the monsoon patterns are affected, monsoon rains are expected to increase over the next decade. &ldquo;External forces, especially from the oceans impact the monsoon and these are being studied. But the thirty year pattern is expected to hold and the next revision might see an increase in the decadal average,&rdquo; said M Ravichandran, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of its update, the IMD said that annual rainfall had decreased to 116 cm from 117.6 cm. Southwest monsoon contributes about 75% of India&rsquo;s total rainfall with June (19%), July (32.3%), August (29.4%) and September contributing 19.3% respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"The rainfall during the southwest monsoon season in 2022 will be 96% to 104% of the Long Period Average (LPA) of 87 cm of the 1971-2020 period, the IMD said.\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/1ymtzd/article65320553.ece/alternates/FREE_660/IMG_bl12Think1Cover_2_1_TB9N09Q9.jpg\" style=\"width:660px\" /></p>\r\n","section_id":"6"}]

It published a report, suggesting ways and means to keep the rise in temperatures down to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In this context, it will be interesting to read Vandana Shiva&rsquo;s memoir, <em>Terra Viva</em> (Women Unlimited), in which she talks about her life working with farmers&rsquo; and people&rsquo;s movements across the world against &ldquo;seed imperialism&rdquo;, economic polarisation and the &ldquo;digital colonisation of our ecological and social diversity.&rdquo; She looks ahead to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis, the privatisation of biotechnology, and the &ldquo;commodification of our biological and natural resources.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reviews, we read G.N. Devy&rsquo;s re-appraisal of the <em>Mahabharata</em> and its enduring appeal, a biography of Captain Krishnan Nair, who founded the Leela chain of hotels when he was 65 years old, a veteran scribe&rsquo;s journey as a sports writer, Stephen Alter&rsquo;s new novel and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Books of the week</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Literary Review\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/7ocqrl/article65314337.ece/alternates/FREE_660/30LR%20DEVY.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Mahabharata </em>inhabits a crowded field in epic literature but has a unique place in the Indian imagination. It shines bright despite the historical precedence of the <em>Ramayana </em>and its obvious lineages in the obscurity of the Vedas <em>. </em>Philosophically, there are other scriptures dense with meaning that have engaged scholarly attention far longer. What then accounts for India&rsquo;s enduring fascination with the <em>Mahabharata</em>? Literary critic and archaeologist of language Ganesh N. Devy attempts to answer this in his book, <em>Mahabharata, The Epic and the Nation</em> (Aleph). In his review, Sukumar Muralidharan writes that the essence of the <em>Mahabharata </em>is perhaps its recounting of a story where the origins are &ldquo;perennially open&rdquo;, affording a unique civilisational foundation for India. Unlike other epics, it has no single protagonist who provides narrative continuity from beginning to end, aside from Ved Vyasa himself. &ldquo;The <em>Mahabharata </em>is a way of perceiving a past of many beginnings, where time in all its dimensions &ndash;cosmic, mythical, historical and psychological -- fuse together. There are aspects of the <em>Mahabharata </em>that legitimise the worst of an ascriptive, hierarchical social order. But in the vastness of its sprawl, it provides a richness of narrative detail and moral ambiguities, to be a relatable tale for all.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><em><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/mahabharata-the-epic-and-the-nation-review-mahabharatas-enduring-appeal/article65289578.ece\" target=\"_self\">Mahabharata, The Epic and the Nation</a></em><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/mahabharata-the-epic-and-the-nation-review-mahabharatas-enduring-appeal/article65289578.ece\" target=\"_self\"> review: <em>Mahabharata</em>&rsquo;s enduring appeal</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Captain Krishnan Nair was a bit of a &ldquo;rolling stone&rdquo; in his early days ( <em>Capture the Dream</em>/Bachi Karkaria &ndash; Juggernaut). He joined the army, resigned, ventured into supervising ration distribution in Kerala, joined politics for a while and then went back to the army. The smart armyman impressed a local industrialist in Kannur who got his daughter Leela married to him. Every project of the captain was named after Leela, his &ldquo;guiding force&rdquo;. It was Leela who wanted captain to build a hotel. But first, says the reviewer Sushila Ravindranath, Captain Nair joined his father-in-law&rsquo;s handloom business as a sales agent. Thus began his foray into handlooms and exports. Success came when he introduced the &lsquo;Bleeding Madras&rsquo;, a humble homespun fabric, to the U.S. His entrepreneurial brain was always ticking. When he was 65 years old, Captain Nair entered the competitive hotel industry. He wanted to prove to international visitors that India can build world class hotels and even outdo them. He was not fazed by the existing top class competition, Taj, Oberoi and the ITC groups. &ldquo;At every stage of his life, he managed to achieve what he wanted to, turning disadvantages into advantages.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><em><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/capture-the-dream-the-many-lives-of-captain-cp-krishnan-nair-review-in-his-time-captain-krishnan-nair-played-many-parts/article65289492.ece\" target=\"_self\">Capture the Dream: The Many Lives of Captain C.P.

Magazine isn&rsquo;t merely offering snapshots or player-profiles, says the reviewer K.C. Vijaya Kumar. &ldquo;He is also constantly placing them within the boundaries imposed by a nation in a state of flux. India&rsquo;s post-independence pangs to its gradual evolution through the religion-cum-caste matrix before liberalisation and relatively better social and economic indices helped cricket gain heft, are all mentioned. He also admits that the country&rsquo;s sensibilities may have changed but there was a time when its sporting moments weren&rsquo;t essentially coated in the &lsquo;kind of jingoism we abhor&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><em><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/not-just-cricket-review-on-and-off-the-field/article65289442.ece\" target=\"_self\">Not Just Cricket</a></em><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/not-just-cricket-review-on-and-off-the-field/article65289442.ece\" target=\"_self\"> review: On and off the field</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Birdwatching</em> (Aleph) is set in the unruffled universe of New Delhi in early 1962, when a seemingly peaceful world is turned upside down after an ornithologist, Guy Fletcher, stumbles on a corpse. The man is white and he&rsquo;s clearly been shot &ndash; this discovery triggers far-reaching reactions. With Indian and U.S. intelligence agencies involved in the cover-up, Fletcher is soon bundled off to the U.S. But once in the U.S., the CIA approaches him, telling him his fluent Hindi and his cover as an ornithologist are very useful assets. Fletcher accepts their offer to join the agency, not least because he can live in India, and thereby hangs a thrilling tale. In her review, Ranjana Sengupta writes that the novel has a certain deliberate, unhurried pace rather like, one imagines, the art of watching birds. Each chapter too begins with a bird description and the bird finds its way into the chapter, often just a flutter of wings, but a happy distraction from the combustible geopolitics of the moment, a sign that the natural world goes on even as men get ready to kill each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/society/ranjana-sengupta-reviews-stephen-alters-birdwatching/article65273302.ece\" target=\"_self\">They come home to roost: Ranjana Sengupta reviews Stephen Alter&rsquo;s &lsquo;Birdwatching&rsquo;</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Spotlight</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"A portrait of sad poor mature mother talking to small daughter indoors at home, poverty concept.\" src=\"https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/90zrfb/article65314345.ece/alternates/FREE_660/IMG_10LR_Srilata1_2_1_189LJ0CL.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her column Women of Letters, K. Srilata writes about Tillie Olsen&rsquo;s story, &lsquo;I Stand Here Ironing&rsquo;. Narrated in the first person, the story about a working class single mother has the &ldquo;layered richness and intimacy of an interior monologue.&rdquo; It begins with the narrator receiving a call from her daughter Emily&rsquo;s school counsellor to come in and talk to her about her daughter. &ldquo;Though the story is seemingly about Emily&rsquo;s troubles, we see quickly enough what it really is about: the gut-wrench of parenting when you are poor and single, the guilt that corrodes your soul like acid, the shame of having failed a test that no one is meant to clear.&rdquo; An American writer born to Russian Jewish emigrants, Olsen dropped out at the age of 15 to enter the workforce. She wrote when she found &ldquo;snatches of time&rdquo;. Olsen was 49 when her first book, a collection of four short stories, <em>Tell me a Riddle</em>, was published, of which &lsquo;I Stand Here Ironing&rsquo; is the opening one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/society/a-tribute-to-american-writer-tillie-olsen/article65273307.ece\" target=\"_self\">The writer whose story was meant for me</a> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Browser</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><em>The Dalit Truth</em> (Penguin Random House), edited by K.
