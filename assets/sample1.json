Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli directed him to surrender within a week.\n\nThe order, read out in court by Justice Kant for the Bench, said the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction, denied victims a chance to participate in the bail proceedings and was in a \"tearing hurry\" to grant bail. He said the court, taking all these factors under consideration, could \"rightfully cancel the bail\".",
